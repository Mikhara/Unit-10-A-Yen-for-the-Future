### Trending upwards
Appling the HP Filter to decompose our Settle prices into trend and non-trend (noise) components, we can observe that there was a rapid upward trend from 2016-2017 with a crash occurring in 2017. The crash in 2017 is most likely a result of the USD experiencing a consistent decline in that year, what some had labelled - "The Trump Slump" (https://internationalbanker.com/brokerage/us-dollar-consistently-falling-throughout-2017/).

The trend continues upward, at a more gradual pace, from the crash in 2017-2020. Based on the HP Filter trend data, I would buy the Yen now, expecting a continuation of an upward trend. Let's see what our forecasting models say!
